# about

This github will only contain my public code.  This code is either for teaching purposes or it's a problem I found and solved and released to the public.. I keep the larger projects to myself.

The teaching code (and problem-solving code) is kept deliberately simple and will not include any backwards compatibility issues.
I believe HTML5 makes it possible with a very shallow development stack, while the current trend seems to be to make development stacks deeper and deeper. It will be harder and harder to write code this way that will last 10 years.
However, HTML5 makes that possible in principle. So that's my goal, write code that will work without any problems in 10 years.

Once students understand the basics, 
I can introduce them via canIuse to concepts like vendor-prefixing, grunt, obfuscation, minifying ,polyfills and shims. Use them with caution and predict how likely they are to break your code, before you use them.
