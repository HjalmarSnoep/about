# about

This github will only contain my public code.  This code is for teaching purposes only.
The code is kept deliberately simple and will not include any backwards compatibility issiues.

Once students understand the basics, I introduce them via canIuse to concepts like vendor-prefixing, gruntings, obfuscation, minifying ,polyfills and shims.
